# Emotional-Detector
The Emotion Detector is a desktop application that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect human emotions from images. The application is built with Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and uses a model trained on the FER (Facial Expression Recognition) dataset to predict emotions. Users can upload an image, and the application will predict and display the emotion depicted in the image.

## Features
-**Image Upload:** Users can upload an image from their local device.
-**Emotion Prediction:** The application predicts the emotion displayed in the uploaded image using a pre-trained CNN model.
-**User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and intuitive desktop interface built with Tkinter.
-**Emotion Examples:** Displays examples of different emotions below the main interface for reference.

## Technologies Used
-**Python:** For building the application and training the model.
-**Tkinter:** For creating the graphical user interface.
-**TensorFlow/Keras:** For developing and training the CNN model for emotion detection.
-**OpenCV:** For image processing.
-**PIL (Python Imaging Library):** For handling image files.
